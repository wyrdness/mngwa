      "full": "The **Mngwa** (also known as **Nunda**) is a cryptid feline reported primarily in the coastal regions of Tanzania, East Africa. Described as significantly larger than a lion with distinctive gray, slate-colored, or brindled fur, the Mngwa has been featured in local accounts for generations and gained international attention through documented human attacks in the 1920s-1940s. The creature represents one of the most intriguing African mystery cats, with credible documentation from colonial administrators, including British district officer William Hitchens, who extensively investigated a series of fatal attacks in the Lindi region in 1938. Belgian cryptozoologist Bernard Heuvelmans considered the Mngwa one of the more plausible mystery cats due to consistent eyewitness descriptions and documented incidents. Unlike many cryptids that rely primarily on folklore, the Mngwa has the distinction of documented fatal attacks on humans, physical evidence in the form of tracks and kills, and investigation by credible witnesses including government officials and professional hunters familiar with all known African wildlife."
