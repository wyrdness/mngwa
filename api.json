      "summary": "A large, aggressive mystery cat reported in Tanzania, described as larger than a lion with distinctive gray or brindled fur. Known for documented attacks on humans in the early 20th century.",
      "full": "The Mngwa is a cryptid feline reported primarily in the coastal regions of Tanzania, East Africa. Described as significantly larger than a lion, with gray, slate-colored, or brindled fur, the Mngwa has been featured in local accounts for generations and gained international attention through documented human attacks in the 1920s-1940s. The creature's name comes from the Swahili word meaning 'the strange one.' Belgian cryptozoologist Bernard Heuvelmans extensively researched the Mngwa, considering it one of the more plausible mystery cats due to consistent eyewitness descriptions and documented incidents. Theories range from an unknown species of large cat to melanistic or leucistic variations of known species, to surviving populations of prehistoric felids."
